I need to think of the best way to store the data:

because it is so many lines long I think the best thing to do perhaps would be to make either a json or a csv

playlist, date_added, song_name, artist_name(s), release_type (Single, EP, LP), release_name, release_date, genre, duration(ms), tempo

I can use exportify for now but after awhile I can start developing a spotify web API through JavaScript and perhaps creating a better application so that other users can input their own information

I am not sure where I want to take this I mean I think it would be fun to display how diverse my music tastes have gotten over time and have some cool visuals, so maybe I should work on that first 

First use exportify to generate csv files for each of my playlists and then convert them to one giant well formatted csv
